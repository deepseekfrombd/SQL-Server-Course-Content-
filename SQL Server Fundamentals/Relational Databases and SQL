##• Relational databases overview
A relational database organizes data into tables, where each table represents an entity, and rows represent instances of that entity. Columns define attributes with specific data types. SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft, used for storing, retrieving, and managing structured data.
**Key Concepts:
  •	Tables: Store data in rows and columns.
  •	Relationships: Tables are linked using keys (primary and foreign keys).
  •	Schema: Defines the structure of the database (tables, columns, constraints).
  •	Normalization: Process to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
Example: A database for a bookstore might have tables for Books, Authors, and Orders, linked by keys to maintain relationships.

  •	SQL syntax & DDL/DML operations
  •	Data types, constraints, primary/foreign keys
  •	Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
  •	Subqueries and common table expressions (CTE)
  •	Views and indexes
  •	Transactions & ACID properties
